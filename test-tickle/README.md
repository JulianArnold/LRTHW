## Notes

20210406: fixed snafu with if statement with q_branch and now it looks to be done.

20210322: added to q_branch and will adapt ex14 for this method

20210318: Gibraltar looks done for now, started Q-branch method def.

20210317: Happy St. Paddy's!  check out this site: https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/l/Living-Daylights.php

20210316: started Bratislava module and corrected the rock_chase method; was far too long

20210313: well on now; am writing the first of 5 modules which are all based on geographical locations

20210222: have bones of a diagram, now need a to-do list to go through

20210216: about to start the map (drawing) of the Bond game

20210209: hand-written most of the game which is a multiple-choice variant of the Bond film: The Living Daylights.  
Have listed the actors, the places, the villains and the locations.  Have also added gadgets and plot devices.
Now need a to-do list and a map.

20210126: started reading through the list of rules for if statements, loops and debugging..

20210121: finishing ex35 and starting ex36

20201022: while on ex35, have a read of exit() https://www.sitepoint.com/exit-exit-abort-raise-get-me-outta-here/

20201012: still on ex35, remember this workaround..

```bash
    if choice =~ /\d+/  #'Fn' key + '~ #' gives you a backslash
      how_much = choice.to_i
    else
      dead('Man, learn to type a number!')	
    end
```

20201005: completed ex34 and started on ex35

20200907: Been on ex33 for a couple of weeks.  Going well, is about while loops and ranges

20200625: study drills: https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/Operations_and_Projects

20200529: finished ex30 and moved on to ex31

20200520: started on ex30

20200519: currently on ex29, repeat and reload!

20200505: completed the week of memorizing logic, now on to ex28 Julian's Boolean.

20200421: completed Ex25 and Ex26 was a test of both 24 and 25.  Next up is logic with Ex27.

20200416: end in sight for ex25..  ex26 is a test of ex 24 & 25 so mebbe a little teeny tiny amount of revision.

20200324: https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-the-difference-between-puts-vs-return-when-defining-a-method

20200317: practicing e24; almost done with it..  Just ended ex24.. on to ex25!

20200223: wrapped up ex23, move on to ex24

20200113: for ex23.rb try this: "https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html"

20191107: skimmed through the file next door.. 

20191031: reading here: "http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_access_control.html" also see ex23.rb.


20191019: started ex23.  Main three objectives for this exercise is: 1- Finding Ruby source code for things you need.
2- Reading through the code and looking for files.  3- Trying to understand the code you find.
<https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex23.html>  

20191014: ex22 done, including re-writing a table.  On to ex23.

20190810: stopped on ex21.rb

20190807: stopped at #9 on ex19-1.rb

```bash
$ ruby ex19-1.rb
```


20190804: check this out while writing the text: http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/bonus/string_interpolation.html

20190707: at ex15 and have typed in about open().  Now write about 'read'.  

20190605: ex8 is interesting 99% of the time ;D

20190530: stopped at ex6 tonight

20190520: finished ex21.rb and remember PEMDAS when writing maths fomulae.  On to ex22..

20190411: ditto, which is OK.  If it takes 6 hours or 6 weeks..

20190403: still on ex21..

20190313: and on to ex21..

20190207: Finally completed all 10 ways to deliver a method def.  On to ex20!

20181107: Checklist:

Did you start your function definition with def?

Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?

Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name?

Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?

Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?

Did you put a close parenthesis ) after the arguments?

Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function two spaces?

Did you end your function with end lined up with the def above?

# When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:

Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?

Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?

Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?

Did you end the function call with a ) character?

Functions that don't have parameters do not need the () after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyway?

__________
20180630: ex18 introduced me to functions or method definitions, learned about passing in 0, 1 and 2 arguments and that
parameters share a lot with ARGV (key difference is you're passing into the method rather than a simple script)

```bash
$ ruby ex18.rb
```

20180621: ex17 was mainly about reading one file, copying it's text to another, 2nd file:

```bash
$ ruby ex17.rb text.txt test2.txt
```


20180526: practicing ex16, all study drills complete, #timetomoveon :D

```bash
$ ruby ex16.rb text.txt (to write)
$ ruby ex15.rb text.txt (to read only, returning to console)
```

20180521: still on ex16 incorporated ex15 into it as well and on the last of the study drills

20180411: filled out and got ex16 working, neatly creates and writes to a .txt file.  Kinda cool!

20180408: working through study drill for ex15, stopped at the last two.. try to finish these before moving on.

20180406: playing with ex15, you can open other different txt files from the same code block.  Cool.
```bash
$ ruby ex15.rb ex15.txt
: ex15-1.txt
```
20180405: ditto with ex15: reading external .txt files.

20180402: playing with ex14 a little, changing bits here and there.

20180326: ex13 done, interesting take on ARGV vs. $stdin.gets.chomp.  On to ex14.rb

20180323: keep working on ex12 until you have the sequence down cold

20180322: on ex12, have another look over the code and the comments before reading the study drill

20180319: On ex10.rb, one look at the study drills.

20180318: On ex9.rb, have another go at it.

20180317: next up, ex7.rb

20180316: stopped at ex5.
