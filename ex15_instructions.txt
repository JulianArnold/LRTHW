new variable called filename points to ARGV, which passes in arguments typed in.

new variable txt points to the open() method which contains the filename variable. File name is the argument
passed in via ARGV.  Variable inside open() parenthesis is actually opened up.

once opened, we 'puts' a string with the filename as string interpolation: #{filename}.
Then, we 'print' the txt variable with a 'dot' method to the right: .read which does just that.

round two we're asked to type [print] in the filename again with just a string [no interpolation].
A new variable [file_again] asks a gets.chomp action which grabs the text from the file, similarly to ARGV.

new variable txt_again points to the open() method which opens the new file_again variable.
like above, print new variable is txt_again has a 'dot' method which is '.read' like before.
